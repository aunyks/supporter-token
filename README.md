# Token Factory

Your personal Token Factory. Token Factory lets you mint as many fungible and non-fungible tokens as you'd like, all from the same contract! It also comes with nice-to-have features built in.

## Features

TBD, but trust me!

## What is it, really?

A Token Factory is a contract that extends the ERC-1155 standard to be more creator-friendly.
